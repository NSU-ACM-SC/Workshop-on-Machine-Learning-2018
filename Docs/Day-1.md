# Day - 1:

## What is Machine Learning?
“Machine Learning is the science of getting computers to learn and act like humans do, and improve their learning over time in autonomous fashion, by feeding them data and information in the form of observations and real-world interactions.”.

</p>


## Why Machine Learning?
Machine Learning can be used in detecting anomalies, recommending new products, enhancing customer services and a lot of things. In fact, with the amount of data that is available along with the exceptional computing power machine learning can prove to be extremely useful for future.

More than 80% of companies, around the world, are already planning to use machine learning & AI to enhance their customer experience. There is a lot of innovation happening in the field of machine learning. There is no doubt about the importance of machine learning but the biggest challenge is the lack of expertise. There is a huge potential but the lack of resources is slowing things down a bit.
E.g `Youtube`,`Netflix`, `Spotify recommendations`, `FB instagram ads`, `gmail`, `Disease Identification/Diagnosis`, `Weather Forecasting`, `Video Surveillance`, `Online Customer Support(chatbots)`, `Online fraud detection`, `Autonomous driving`, `Image Recognition`, `Object detection`, `Speech recognition in Alexa`, `Siri` etc.

## How does Machine Learning work?

Machine learning algorithms find natural patterns in data that generate insight and help you make better decisions and predictions. We feed in a set of data and the Machine learns from that data and predicts an output and it can improve that output overtime.

## Tell about our experiences: What are we currently working on..


## Types of Learning:

## Supervised Learning: 
Supervised learning is where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.
                          ``` Y = f(X)
                          ```
<p align="center">
  <img width="560" height="350" src="https://github.com/NeloyNSU/Workshop-on-Machine-Learning-2018/blob/master/Images/2.png">
</p>

The goal is to approximate the mapping function so well that when you have new input data (x) that you can predict the output variables (Y) for that data. what are Inputs and Labels(Targets)?? for example addition of two numbers a=5,b=6 result =11, Inputs are 5,6 and Target is 11.

Supervised learning problems can be further grouped into regression and classification problems.

## Unsupervised Learning: 
Unsupervised Learning is a class of Machine Learning techniques to find the patterns in data. The data given to unsupervised algorithm are not labelled, which means only the input variables(X) are given with no corresponding output variables. In unsupervised learning, the algorithms are left to themselves to discover interesting structures in the data.

</p>

There are also different types for unsupervised learning like `Clustering` and `Anomaly detection` (clustering is pretty famous)

</p>

### Clustering: 
This is a type of problem where we group similar things together.
Bit similar to multi class classification but here we don’t provide the labels, the system understands from data itself and cluster the data.

Some examples are :
- given news articles,cluster into different types of news
- given a set of tweets ,cluster based on content of tweet
- given a set of images, cluster them into different objects

</p>


The training data does not include Targets here so we don’t tell the system where to go , the system has to understand itself from the data we give. Here training data is not structured (contains noisy data,unknown data and etc..)
 ```
 ex: A random articles from different pages

```

## Supervised Machine Learning Types:
- **Regression**
- **Classification**

</p>

### Regression: 
A regression problem is when the output variable is a `real value` (Continuous) , such as “dollars” or “weight”. 

Some examples are
- what is the price of house in a specific city?
- what is the value of the stock?
- how many total runs can be on board in a cricket game?

### Classification: 
A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, (Discrete) such as “red” or “blue” or “disease” and “no disease”.

Some examples are :
- this mail is spam or not?
- will it rain today or not?
- is this picture a cat or not?
- Basically ‘Yes/No’ type questions called binary classification.

Other examples are :
- this mail is spam or important or promotion?
- is this picture a cat or a dog or a tiger?
