## Exploring the Iris Data-Set:

One of the most common datasets that I came across in my journey into the data science world is called Iris. The dataset is a record of feature measurements (petal lengths and widths, sepal lengths and widths) of different species of Iris flowers. It is often used to demonstrate simple machine learning techniques.

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.
